# GPS 1.1

## Michael de Gaetano Reflection

**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

* I was having a difficult time visualizing the pushing, pulling and merging terminology. Some of the terms have similar meanings; pulling, merging, etc, but I definitely have a better handle on it now. Also, we successfully demonstrated that remembering to use proper Git workflow at all times can preempt conflicts down the road

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS session?**

* Many of the questions I had about merging/pulling were clarified

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

* I asked about some clarifications to the synching issues, such as how to get ensure GitHub branches are synched properly with local branches, etc.

**What still confuses you about Git?**

* I think I have a good general idea about the Git protocol and why it is used, I just think I need some more practice with execution

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

* It was great! I'm getting used to the method of remote pairing, I feel like the more I do it, the more comfortable I get with remote pairing. I think Derek and I communicated and worked well, and Matt was able to help us troubleshoot and answer any questions that we had
