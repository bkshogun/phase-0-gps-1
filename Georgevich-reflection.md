# GPS 1.1 Reflection

##Derek Georgevich

1. Prior to this GPS I didn't think I was struggling with any of the concepts. The theory and functionality I understand. Or I think I understand. Just geting used to the syntax and commands will just take time to write to memory. 
2. We clarified a lot during our GPS. Going over commit, and add, and push was very benneficial to both of us. 
3. I think there were a lot of topics that we both questitoned from each other and from Matt. We brought up licensing issues when creating a new repo.
4. I think once I've repeated the steps of Git workflow I won't have any issues. A lot confuses me about Git, but that's only because I know we've only scratched the surface. So it's not necessarily confussion, but more like in awe of what I'll be able to do with Git. 
5. I thought it was a great first experience.  For being our first time it went rather smooth. I feel like we were able to work out most of the problems on our own, except for a small issue here and there.  Communication was great.  I feel like we both gave and took instructions very accurately.  Neither of us were afraid to ask questions or try new ways. Great session, looking forward to more.
